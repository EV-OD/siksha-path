ðŸ“˜ SikshaPath â€“ Project Documentation
1. Introduction

SikshaPath is a Nepal-focused e-learning platform inspired by modern platforms like Unacademy.
It provides a digital path for students to learn, teachers to teach, and administrators to manage, all within a scalable and secure system.

The current phase of the project focuses on API-only development (backend first), with UI/UX implementation planned later.
